What is sleepy_help.sh?

	sleepy_help.sh is a system for a local help menu created by the local user.

How do I use it?

	On line 8 specify a help directory for sleepy help to operate out of, then
	populate the directory with self written help files ending in .txt extensions. 
	When you run sleepy_help.sh the script selects and displays all of the .txt
	files and populates a repl menu from which you can select whichever help page
	that you would like to read.

	When you select a help page sleepy menu opens it using the linux unix less cmd
	this can be changed on line 41 if you prefer a different file viewer.

	You can also use the spawn_sleepy_help.sh script to open the program inside
	a new instance of xterm. 

	I currently use another self created tool called qm (stands for quickmenu) to
	make the spawn_sleepy_help.sh quickly accessible via a gui launcher
